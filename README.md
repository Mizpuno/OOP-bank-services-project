# Bank Systems - Baseon OOP

Using the principle of object-oriented programming, we created the bank services system. There is a virtual bank application running on a "console, terminal" in our software.

## Easy starter
First, you must setup the jdk that support our java code. (we're recommended the Oracle, BellSoft), and don't forget to set the environment path before examine the jdk by check it version. (basic terms to check if java compiler can use or not.
#### Examine JDK 

```
  java -version
```

Next, clone our repository and find this direction " Start.java, Start.class " then run from one of this file. 


## Admin Tokens
The third function of the main page(first page on load) you can see the "user_ref" logs and use to examine your freestyle idea!

```
  Passcode -adminDiiGen4
```

if you want to change to your prefer key access to access this data. change this from this directory "./Start.java"

```
  110)  ...
  111)  if (in1.equals("<key_access>")) {
  112)  ...
```

The data it'll print out from HashMap databases.

| Return Items | Type     | Description                            | Index |
| :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------- |:------|

| ``           | `object` | **non-material** The address of users. | (1)   |
