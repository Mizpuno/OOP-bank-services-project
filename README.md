## Easy starter
First, you must setup the jdk that support our java code. (we're recommended the Oracle, BellSoft), and don't forget to set the environment path before examine the jdk by check it version. (basic terms to check if java compiler can use or not.
#### Examine JDK 

```http
  java -version
```

Next, clone our repository and find this direction " Start.java, Start.class " then run from one of this file. 


## Admin Tokens
The third function of the main page(first page on load) you can see the "user_ref" logs and use to examine your freestyle idea!
